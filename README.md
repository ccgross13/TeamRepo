* Background: JP Morgan Chase is a multinational bank and investment holding company with over two and a half trillion dollars in assets. There only real competitors are the other trillion dollar US banks:  Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs
* Question 3: JP Morgan is the largest bank in the US, therefore they have the most financial resources available to contribute to develop of the firm’s fintech capabilities. According to JPMorgan’s website, the company invests $11 billion on technology per year. They have the ability to invest across the bank’s platform — commercial and investment banking, consumer banking, asset management, and wealth management. Big banks have the benefit of access to consumer and economic data as a result of their size and scope, which they can then leverage to develop products and innovations to their technology platform. JPMorgan has been supporting the Financial Solutions Lab program since 2015. Each year, the program has a different focus of financial technology. The weakness of a large company like JPMorgan is seen in their support of this program, because they are concerned that due to their size, they might not be able to generate the most innovate ideas.
* Question 4: In this scenario, size is the ultimate protection for JPM and it allows them to maintain their dominance in the space. We should expect that they will continue to commit significant amounts of capital each year to further development, integrating their financial and technology capabilities.
